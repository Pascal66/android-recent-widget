TODO:
-----

H- Find other way to handle PopupActivity intent
H- RecentEvent->RecentContact*(1-n)*RecentEvent
H- Check list:isFull condition!

M- SmsDao just retrieves inbox?
M- List is shown in reverse order -> builder adds at beginning but query is sort descending

L- If showing contact on button press, the missed call notification does not go away
L- Why double-initialization on widget creation?

KINDA FIXED / KINDA UGLY:
-------------------------

To Test: H- RWProvider.recentEvents might be garbage-collected -> need to persist? or re-compute?
To Test: H- switch compute recent events in service, or else ANR! See WordWidget
