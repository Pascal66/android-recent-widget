TODO:
-----

HH- When rebuilding list, the personId = 0 !!!
HH- personId/fullName, ... should be fetched elsewhere (info is lost when process is killed)

H- Check list:isFull condition!

M- email content provider
M- When opening Contact page, pressing back shows the list of all Dialer app! cumbersome
M- Override long-press on search?

L- If showing contact on button press, the missed call notification does not go away
L- Why double-initialization on widget creation?
L- Find other way to handle PopupActivity intent (works for now, but might not work with multiple widgets on screen << might have several list of recent events)

KINDA FIXED / TO TEST / KINDA UGLY:
-------------------------

To Test: H- RWProvider.recentEvents might be garbage-collected -> need to persist? or re-compute?
To Test: H- switch compute recent events in service, or else ANR! See WordWidget
TO Test: M- SmsDao just retrieves inbox?
To Test: M- List is shown in reverse order -> builder adds at beginning but query is sort descending
