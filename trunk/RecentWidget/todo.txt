M- email content provider
M- Override long-press on search?
M- CPU: 
	- android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE actually listened twice... observer.supports should also take the intent
		- get new phoneState extra
	- Why double-initialization on widget creation?
M- Use AsyncTask to draw the ActivityPopup
M- layoutopt the views
M- Possible preferences
	- Only show incoming and/or outgoing and/or missed calls
	- Only show sent and/or received sms
	- Popup may show events historically rather than by type
	- Custom Messaging/Dialer app launched from popup
	- Clear Missed Call / SMS notification on popup?
	
L- Use Bundle to save the state when Holder is killed... how?
L- Find other way to handle PopupActivity intent (works for now, but might not work with multiple widgets on screen << might have several list of recent events)
L- Make sure content providers are disposed
L- Close popup when clicking outside popup window

KINDA FIXED / TO TEST / KINDA UGLY:
-------------------------

test: H- RWProvider.recentEvents might be garbage-collected -> need to persist? or re-compute?
test: H- switch compute recent events in service, or else ANR! See WordWidget
test: M- SmsDao just retrieves inbox?
test: M- List is shown in reverse order -> builder adds at beginning but query is sort descending
test: HH- When rebuilding list, the personId = 0 !!!
test: HH- personId/fullName, ... should be fetched elsewhere (info is lost when process is killed)
test: HH- TelephonyListener is killed? detached?
test: H- Check list:isFull condition!
test: H- Add more info on popup (at least for debug!)
test: M- When opening Contact page, pressing back shows the list of all Dialer app! cumbersome
	- New task on showing Activity Popup
		- activity popup should be forgotten has soon as possible
	- Intent from Activity Popup should have the popup in its affinity
		-> will not be grouped with the actual target application
test: H- Duplicate events in list...
