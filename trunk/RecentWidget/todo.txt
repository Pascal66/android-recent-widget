TODO:
-----

Change description with wording "Direct access to..."

H- PERF of rebuild list!!!
	- create debug log with stats/summaries
H- Some queries on SMS events do not return associated contact

H- Market:
	x logo
	x widget frame
	x about page
		- add links, etc (make a web view?)
	- website
		- add screenshots
	x popup design/info... missed calls icons, ...

H- add arrow to educate on possible fling gesture
H- CPU: 
	- android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE actually listened twice... observer.supports should also take the intent
		- get new phoneState extra
	- Why double-initialization on widget creation?
M- show last SMS content from contact?
M- Swipe on popup -> next/previous recent contact?
M- Call event on popup: "30 minutes ago..." "yesterday 8:20pm"

M- Widget display
	- show whether sms was read or not
	- show if call missed for given contact
M- Merged contacts show as 2 separate contacts
	- must get id on dao access
M- Add event info on popup: Home, Mobile, ...
M- gTalk provider?
M- email content provider
M- Facebook provider?
	- show button even if no notif
M- Bug: if list is not finished, remainder of previous page is still displayed
M- bothering: if compose sms activity was called, clicking on a contact goes back to that compose activity
M- Possible preferences
	- Only show incoming and/or outgoing and/or missed calls
	- Only show sent and/or received sms
	- Popup may show events historically rather than by type
	- Custom Messaging/Dialer app launched from popup
	- Clear Missed Call / SMS notification on popup?
	- Only show on widget if contact exists (ignore unknown contacts and unknown numbers?)
M- Button to add number without contact to directory
M- Landscape: icons are not aligned with home icons
M- inactivity brings page cursor to 1?
M- layoutopt the views (does not work!?)
M- If caller unknown, do not let SMS/Call actions to be clicked
	- remove icon to make sure people don't click or use toast to warn?

L- Use AsyncTask to draw the ActivityPopup
L- Use Bundle to save the state when Holder is killed... how?
L- Find other way to handle PopupActivity intent:onKeyPress (works for now, but might not work with multiple widgets on screen << might have several list of recent events)
L- Make sure content providers are disposed
L- Close popup when clicking outside popup window
L- When just added a custom number, refresh the widget also?

?- Override long-press on search?

KINDA FIXED / TO TEST / KINDA UGLY:
-------------------------

test: H- RWProvider.recentEvents might be garbage-collected -> need to persist? or re-compute?
test: H- switch compute recent events in service, or else ANR! See WordWidget
test: M- SmsDao just retrieves inbox?
test: M- List is shown in reverse order -> builder adds at beginning but query is sort descending
test: HH- When rebuilding list, the personId = 0 !!!
test: HH- personId/fullName, ... should be fetched elsewhere (info is lost when process is killed)
test: HH- TelephonyListener is killed? detached?
test: H- Check list:isFull condition!
test: H- Add more info on popup (at least for debug!)
test: M- When opening Contact page, pressing back shows the list of all Dialer app! cumbersome
0.4: H- Duplicate events in list...
0.4: H- Bug on N1: no default pic on contact with no picture
0.4: H- Bug on N1: unknown number shown as "-1"
0.4: H- Empty SMS button should go to compose window?
0.4: M- Change absoluteLayout in recentwidget.xml to frameLayout
0.4: H- phone log is not always updated right away	-> use timer?
0.4: H- bugfix: list might display empty when first creating the widget
0.4: H- Number with/without prefix are shown as 2 separate contacts? at calllogdao time, find by cached name instead of number?



NOTES:
------

Rel 0.3: +/- 11/06
Rel 0.4:

Notes on tasks and activities:

	- New task on showing Activity Popup
		- activity popup should be forgotten has soon as possible
		- BUT what if we want the back button (eg. from dialer) to return to the popup?
	- Intent from Activity Popup should have the popup in its affinity
		-> will not be grouped with the actual target application
